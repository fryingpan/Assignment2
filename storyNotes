You always knew you were a little different.
But you couldn't say exactly how.

Maybe that's why no one wanted to play with you.
You're tired of having to dealing with this disrespect.

And that is why I have to TAKE OVER THE WORLD.
By KILLING EVERYONE.

As you bask in your glory, you realize something.
lettuce: man i thought we were friends

There are still food people in the nearby chili land who are
still alive and smug and terrible. You can't let this continue.

You've bested the heated and horrible chili land! But what's this?


...Somehow there is an icecream land nearby! How charming. And full of stupid food people. You know what to do.
burger: moving on these ice pads is hard and i do not like it

*****Hey Katie, can you put these in banners at appropriate times? Can you piece them apart as necessary?*******
Objective: Kill all the food people. They're terrible and not nice.

****Maybe when he sees/gets near a cheese wall
You are lactose-intolerant, and therefore you can't eat through cheese walls. Look for lactase pills to take to eat through them!
(The ice creams are soy ice creams. All of them are soy.)

You just killed a food person! You can either eat its corpse-uh-drop-for health or pick up it up to use as a weapon!

Tiles
Blocks
Shrubbery
Door
Button/key

======================
layers should all coincide with each other

From bottom to top
1 (ground tiles)
2 blocks
3 enemies & player & player weapon
4 screen displays (health/score, win etc)

I think all sprites within the layer groups need to
have the same arguments for update....

First get the tiles below the blocks and then handle the next parts
