Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

The game now starts with a cutscene, which you can push 'space' to go through, and 'q' to skip.
After a cutscene ends, there's a significant laf that we plan to fix in the next week.
At the top, there is a banner that informs players of what their current objective is.
Press n to flip through the current objective.
When the player gets near the cheese wall, (our 'locked' door), the player will be told
to find the lactase (key) (currently the door disappears upon touching the key, but we
play to change it to needing to unlock/eat the door).
The key and door does not disappear properly, but you can go through them. We plan to
fix this problem later.

The other side has many enemies that
the player must kill to win.

We implemented dirty sprites to allow the game to run more smoothly with the tiling system.
A cutscene class was added for easier cutscene creation
