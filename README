Implemented this week:
Joystick: Upon entering game, enter 'y' to use joystick.
All button presses work. I used a Logitech Gamepad F310.
Here I will list all corresponding buttons to Peter's specific
joystick - the one included in his hardcoded joystick.py
Back button: exits. (L7 on Peter's joystick.)
A button: attack. (1 button on Peter's joystick.)
B button: pickup item. (2 button.)
X button: make trap. (3 button.)
Y button: trash / drop item. (4 button.)
L1 button: eat item. (L5.)
R1 button: Read Objective. (R6.)
Joy Hat #9 and Joy Axis #7 dictate movement.
Due to pygame joystick button detection, some button presses may
be missed. We believe this is not due to our code, since upon 
printing all button press events, we notice that not all expected
events are printed. (For example, a button press will be detected,
but not it's equivalent button up event. This occurs with the arrow
keys too.)

Added STAGES to levels. Each stage has an educational component.

FINAL CUTSCENE.

Pep8'd everything.
