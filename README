On Problem 3: Scores
As of right now, every time you kill one enemy, you gain one point.
The score is displayed on the lower left corner (along with health).
Upon exiting the game and opening the high score page, your new score
will be updated (the highscores.py module first writes the new score onto the scores.txt and then reads it before rendering it onto the game screen).
