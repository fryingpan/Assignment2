Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

We have created a second level: Chili. We introduce more enemies as well as the Oven "pads" that damage the player if the player walks over it. If you kill all enemies in level one, you win that level and move on to level 2.

The implementation of the oven (and later, the fridge) pads is much like the tiles for grass because the player can walk over these pads. In the game's update method, we check for rect collision. If the Player runs over this pad, his health decreases.

In general game coding progress, we have used this week to refactor our code. We worked with James to better organize our modules and make it so that adding modules in the future would be easier.
We got rid of extraneous methods and made sure that correct code are in each state's respective render and update methods.


Todo List
----------
-Find a way to compress imgs! - Mary
-Mary - fix banner
-Tiles: Mary will fix shrubs, etc for alpha
-item system
    -probably don't need to KEEP key in an inventory; simply open the door when you get the key?
        -inventory includes key
    -when player runs over an item, press one key to eat and different key to pick up as weapon.
    -maybe don't need inventory then? Always hold one item only.
    -Have icon at bottom: tell what item you're holding, if you're holding a pill
        -key to drop item in case player picked it up by accident
        -item uses different key from frying pan
    -Icecream weapon: let player drop puddles (show how many puddles you have left to drop)

Carla:
    -have enemy drop item when killed
    -player pick up item
    -player use item (w/key other than space bar)    

Enemy
	-Enemy AI: follow player when you get close

-Weapons - Katie
    -fix animation - Katie
-look into why damage is wonky
-music/sound

-more enemies
-life bar
    -could change to tablets?
