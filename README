Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

Added a new level 4.

-List how many enemies are on each level:
Level 1:
Level 2:
Level 3: 11
Level 4: 7

Defeat all enemies on a level to get to the next level!

Implemented this week:
-Level effects on enemies. In the "hot" level 2, ice cream
enemies drop more puddles. Burgers move faster. In the
"cold" level 3, ice cream puddles last longer on the ground,
and burgers have more health points.
-We have made our levels harder by making the maps larger
and adding more enemies.
-New Lettuce enemy added. It is an enemy that does not move,
but throws projectiles that hurt the player.
-Cupcake enemy is similar to lettuce, but throws larger and
slower projectiles.
-lvl 4 graphics added
-fixed signs glitches; we plan to add more signs later.

Todo List
----------

Somebody do this:
    -implement level effects on enemies
        -ice cream drops more puddles more quickly in hot lv
        but does the opposite in cold. Not sure if icecream
        dying off quicker is a good idea, maybe make the
        puddles stay for a super long time in cold?
        -burger moves faster in hot, more hp in cold
    -change the win/lose to display different dialogs (random)
    -Make frying pan dmg more accurate
    -burger drop effects; not sure why I made so many drops for
    burger :( Maybe make them give you an effect when equipped?
    Meat makes your attack stronger, bread makes you faster, etc?
    Need to implement random explosion upon eating burger sometime

===================
===================

Carla:
    -make the enemy jump back when attacked
    -burger drops
        - meat = longer invincibility count
        - lettuce = projectile but for now trap
        - bread = double the speed
        - burger = trap

Mary:
    -fix signs
    -make lettuce enemy
    -make lv 4 graphics

Katie
   -Add eating door sound
   -level effects on enemies   
   -attempt to fix the high scores thing where it makes you
enter your name a bajillion times
