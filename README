Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

Since we did most of our refactoring last week, we spent this week
fixing bugs and adding features that we didn't get to fully implement.

-The burger enemy now follows the player; The burger has 3 hp and will
drop 3 items before being killed
	-we still have to ork out kinks in the burger movement (collision
	with walls makes it teleport)
-we refactored the level changing such that we may change the levels
by incrementing the self.level as opposed to using 'magic numbers.'
	-Lvl_data class was added to hold levels' data
-otherwise, we did genera refactoring like making the code more neat
and more efficient.


Todo List
----------
-Find a way to compress imgs! - Mary
-Mary - fix banner
-Tiles: Mary will fix shrubs, etc for alpha
-item system
    -probably don't need to KEEP key in an inventory; simply open the door when you get the key?
        -inventory includes key
    -when player runs over an item, press one key to eat and different key to pick up as weapon.
    -maybe don't need inventory then? Always hold one item only.
    -Have icon at bottom: tell what item you're holding, if you're holding a pill
        -key to drop item in case player picked it up by accident
        -item uses different key from frying pan
    -Icecream weapon: let player drop puddles (show how many puddles you have left to drop)

Carla:
    -have enemy drop item when killed
    -player pick up item
    -player use item (w/key other than space bar)    

Enemy
	-Enemy AI: follow player when you get close

-Weapons - Katie
    -fix animation - Katie
-look into why damage is wonky
-music/sound

-more enemies
-life bar
    -could change to tablets?
