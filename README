=====================
Problem 1: Enemies
=====================
The ice cream enemies will make the player lose 1 health
every time they touch. To attack the player, the ice cream leaves puddles
randomly in their path. These puddles also hurt the player and decrease
its health by 1. These puddles are stationary but multiple puddles can be 
left in around the same area if it so happens that the ice cream is roaming
around that area. The ice cream enemy moves around randomly though they tend 
to roam around in a compact area meaning that they are constantly turning 
randomly and seem to go in circles. The ice cream is bound by solid ground
and they collide with the walls around them just like the player. 

=====================
Problem 2: Damage, Win, Lose
=====================
The player starts off with a health equal to 10, For now, every time the player 
collides with an enemy or a puddle, their health is decremented by 1. After 
they collide with something that hurts them they have a small period of 
invincibility where during that period they can't be hurt. This period is relatively
short and lasts for about 3 seconds which is just about enough time for the player 
to run away from harm. The player has a weapon that is activated when the user 
presses the spacebar. This weapon kills the ice cream enemy after one hit and then 
the enemy disapears. Once all the enemies disappear then the user wins and an image
pops up telling him so. Otherwise, if the player's health goes to 0 then the user 
loses and an image pops up telling him so. In either case the user is taken back 
to the menu. 
=====================
Problem 3: Scores
=====================
As of right now, every time you kill one enemy, you gain one point.
The score is displayed on the lower left corner (along with health).
Upon exiting the game and opening the high score page, your new score
will be updated (the highscores.py module first writes the new score onto the scores.txt and then reads it before rendering it onto the game screen).
