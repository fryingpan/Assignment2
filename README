Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

Added a new level 4.

-List how many enemies are on each level:
Level 1:  3
Level 2:  3
Level 3: 11
Level 4: 7

Defeat all enemies on a level to get to the next level!

Implemented this week:
-Level effects on enemies. In the "hot" level 2, ice cream
enemies drop more puddles. Burgers move faster. In the
"cold" level 3, ice cream puddles last longer on the ground,
and burgers have more health points.
-We have made our levels harder by making the maps larger
and adding more enemies.
-New Lettuce enemy added. It is an enemy that does not move,
but throws projectiles that hurt the player.
-Cupcake enemy is similar to lettuce, but throws larger and
slower projectiles. - however, the images cause the file
to exceed the max size limit, so we will figure out a way
to compress them before adding.
-lvl 4 graphics added
-fixed signs glitches; we plan to add more signs later.
