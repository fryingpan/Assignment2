        -inventory includes key
    -when player runs over an item, press one key to eat and different key to pick up as weapon.
    -maybe don't need inventory then? Always hold one item only.
    -Have icon at bottom: tell what item you're holding, if you're holding a pill
        -key to drop item in case player picked it up by accident
        -item uses different key from frying pan
    -Icecream weapon: let player drop puddles (show how many puddles you have left to drop)
