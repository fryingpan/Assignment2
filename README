Part 1
=======
The player normally moves at a speed of .8. For acceleration, the player will start at 0 and go to .8 at .2 intervals (0,.2,.4,.6,.8) and deceleration will work the opposite way.

Note that the current acceleration and deceleration speeds are subject to change since we would like to determine the enemy speeds and other obstacles before determining a final accel/decel speed. The player only decelerates after accelrating.

Note that the player does not always accelerate/decelerate when moving since we've used the get_key_pressed method to detect when to accelerate/decelerate, but this method does not always detect when we press the keys.

Bugs
---------
We've prevented the program from crashing under these bugs in a try/except block, but here are some errors we can't fix.

-----------
There is a bug when you try to accelerate too much repeatedly
(very quickly tap the direction keys over and over). However,
we believe that this may be the fault of the built-in method ,
get_key_pressed, which does not always detect when the key is 
pressed quickly enough to utilize our methods, as seen in the 
following stdout printout.

bug printout:
accel interval 0.0
x 11.600000000000001 y 310.40000000000134
accel interval 0.2
x 11.600000000000001 y 310.60000000000133
accel interval 0.4
x 11.600000000000001 y 311.0000000000013
accel interval 0.6
x 11.600000000000001 y 311.60000000000133

*This accel works just fine, but the following printout (which
occurs immediately after the lines above, do not work because
we were tapping the direction key so rapidly that the get_key
method failed to detect it)

accel interval 0.0
x 11.600000000000001 y 311.60000000000133
accel interval 0.2

--------------
Another bug is that the player does not clearly decelerate, but from the following code, the player's x and y are changing at the decelerated rate (.8 then .6 then .4 then .2) if you look at the y values.

Part 2
For the drawing, the drawing.py takes in a text file and draws on the blocks
on the text file to the screen. 
The collision does not fully work. It works when the player's right side collides with the wall but otherwise it teleports. Why? It is currently unknown.
