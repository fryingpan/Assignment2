Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

New features were added for the player this week. Everytime he defeats an 
ice cream enemy they drop an ice cream scoop. The ice cream scoop is 
available for a short period of time before it disappears. The player can pick up the 
item by pressing the 's' key to use it as a trap for other enemies or they
can choose to eat it by pressing the 'e' key to earn an extra 10 health points.
If they drop the trap, the trap will be live for a short period of time before
it expires and disappears. If they choose to eat it then the item will disappear.
To drop the trap, the 'a' key is pressed. Then, if an enemy touches the trap, 
they disappear. For now, the player can drop a total of 10 traps after picking up
the item. If the player desides they don't want the item and they want to drop it,
they can press the 'd' key to get rid of it. 
Another new feature is that the ice pads have an effect on the player. It slows
the player's movement for a moment, as if he was freezing.

New graphics were also made for level 3, and old graphics (such as damage frames
and walls in lvl1) were updated and fixed. The player now may open multiple doors
given that he has lactase pills for them (originally, the pill opened all doors
on the map). The burger will now only follow the player within a restricted area.
The idea is to force the player to search for the enemies instead of letting the
enemies easily come to him.

New music is added to level 2. Original source from spacebrain/upfront.

Todo List
----------

Somebody do this:
    -do we want something fancy to blend tile imgs?
        lv 4 is going to be a combo of hot/cold, but not
        sure if we got time to be that fancy
    -implement level effects on enemies
        -ice cream drops more puddles more quickly in hot lv
        but does the opposite in cold. Not sure if icecream
        dying off quicker is a good idea, maybe make the
        puddles stay for a super long time in cold?
        -burger moves faster in hot, more hp in slow
    -change the win/lose to display different dialogs (random)
    -Make frying pan dmg more accurate
    -burger drop effects; not sure why I made so many drops for
    burger :( Maybe make them give you an effect when equipped?
    Meat makes your attack stronger, bread makes you faster, etc?
    Need to implement random explosion upon eating burger sometime
