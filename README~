Run the following to run the program:
python masterfile.py

Since we did most of our refactoring last week, we spent this week
fixing bugs and editing features that we didn't get to fully implement.

-The burger enemy now follows the player; The burger has 3 hp and will
drop 3 items before being killed
	-we still have to work out kinks in the burger movement (collision
	with walls makes it teleport)
-we refactored the level changing such that we may change the levels
by incrementing the self.level as opposed to using 'magic numbers.'
	-Lvl_data class was added to hold levels' data
-otherwise, we did genera refactoring like making the code more neat
and more efficient.
-Both burgers and icecreams will hurt you. Be careful.

-Pep8'd all modules that we use.
-We also fixed the player attacks such that the images don't flicker, and the collision detection to kill enemies only works when the weapon collides with the enemy (and not the player himself). This was a problem because we ended up making the weapon and player into one unified image / sprite, so every time a weapon hit an enemy, it also hurt the player. This is fixed.

-We have a better level 2! A new text mapfile that adds the Heat Pads which hurt the player. 
-The bugs in the items and drop system are also fixed.


Todo List
----------

-Tutorial (in banners)
    -change to signs (press 'r' to read)
    -How to use items
    -fix cheese door tutorial
    -start with sign at beginning to tell you how to read signs (press 'n' to read through)

-item system
    -probably don't need to KEEP key in an inventory; simply open the door when you get the key?
        -inventory includes key
    -when player runs over an item, press one key to eat and different key to pick up as weapon.
    -maybe don't need inventory then? Always hold one item only.
    -Have icon at bottom: tell what item you're holding, if you're holding a pill
        -key to drop item in case player picked it up by accident
        -item uses different key from frying pan
    -Icecream weapon: let player drop puddles (show how many puddles you have left to drop)
    -be able to use or eat
